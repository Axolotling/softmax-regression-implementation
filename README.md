# Softmax Regression Implementation

This project was created with the goal implementation of Softmax Regression Classifier in python programming language.

Main restriction was to not use scikit-learn or any similar library, that already implements many needed functions, with an exception of using it to download a dataset.

Usage of the classifier on a dataset is only to present capabilities of the model implementation. Best score possible was not a goal of this project.
